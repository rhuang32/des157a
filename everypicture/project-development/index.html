    <h1>Developing my Every Picture Project</h1>
    
        <p>I redesigned my home and developed an overlay for the project about. The experiment's flaws primary resided in the lack of transparency with the "why?". It had nice visuals but how do I tell the story of the designers' work in which I'm exploring, understanding and showing appreciation for. I went with a showroom style gallery with intermediate-level mouse positioning.For the overlay, I wanted to keep it simple and just an image with a brief description on how the project made me feel when I was helping to document the photo process.</p>
