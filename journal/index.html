                <h2>Ethics about form design</h2>
                <p>
                    Reading "Best practices for form design" gave me useful tips on making forms that put users first. The article stresses keeping things simple using clear labels, and having a logical order in form design. These methods cut down on mental effort and make it easy for people to use forms leading to happier users. One idea that stuck with me was using inline checks to give quick feedback stopping users from sending in forms with missing or wrong info. This fits with the goal of cutting down on user frustration while making forms easier to use.

                <h2>Duolingo's sign up flow</h2>
                <p>
                    A sign-up process that stuck with me was the one on Duolingo. It's simple, straightforward, and splits everything into bite-sized doable steps. As I went through it, the progress bars made me feel like I was getting somewhere, and the instant checks for stuff like email and password made the whole thing feel smooth and easy.
                </p>
                <h2>Why it matters for us designers</h2>
                <p>
                    The article made me realize how significant empathizing with your users is in the short and long run. Forms are ubiquitous, and when designed effectively, they can truly enhance a user's experience all throughout. This article definitely motivated me to approach my form designs with a more thoughtful perspective—focusing approach.
