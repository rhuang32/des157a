                <h2>Samantha's Selection</h2>
                <p>
                    The image of the vending machines is visually striking because of its repetition and uniformity, yet it feels distinctly personal with the glimpse of a passerby in traditional clothing. What makes it interesting is the contrast between mass-produced objects and human presence—something we wouldn’t immediately notice at first glance. The soft, almost dreamy lighting adds a nostalgic quality, making it feel more like a memory than just a snapshot of a street scene.

                <h2>My Selection</h2>
                <p>
                    This illuminated textile sculpture, Yuan Lamp, explores the interplay between fabric tension and light diffusion, with each fold carefully engineered to create specific shadow patterns. As part of my light-based student project archive collection, it represents my interest in diving into each students' emotional perspective and resonation for their respective works. The piece demonstrates my fascination with the duality between structure and softness, using a golden ring to create an hourglass form that shapes both the fabric and light. To enhance future documentation, I would plan to photograph the piece in complete darkness and capture its transformation from unlit to illuminated states and more closer-up views.

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    At the heart of navigating the media landscape, designers and viewers akin inherit a median balance of visual literacy and visual thinking integration. Images can communicate emotion, narrative, and ideology independent of words and comprise a powerful mode of communication. The ability to perceive and interpret images critically is important in informed decision-making and the creation of meaningful designs.

 
                </p>
                <h2> Shot in Motion</h2>
                <p>
                    In the article, "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills", I learned how images that could be provoking thought, sparking curiosity, and calling for further exploration went far beyond mere visuals; it called on context, composition, and implicit messages in a story being told by every picture. A close reading of an image reinforces the capacity of one's interpreting and making sense visually from the world; that is a core competence every designer should acquire.
                </p>
                <h2>Vwlab: Animation Amazon</h2>
                <p>
                    One such website that incorporates innovative use of image and interaction is Volkswagen's Virtual Art Space. This website converts user interaction into a dynamic, immersive experience, fusing technology and visual storytelling in an engaging way. The site’s strengths include the seamless integration of motion, interactivity, and high-quality imagery that really engage the user and enhance interaction. The one possible disadvantage could be that its graphically complicated design overwhelms users, especially those who are not familiar with such interactive Web experiences. Nevertheless, it’s a great example of how good image and interaction design can enhance digital experiences. Overall, I gained an appreciation for how images shape perception and interaction. Critical skills in working with visual media is a prerequisite for designers, but like everyone living in the information-intensive modern world, everyone needs to become visually literate to communicate better in our designs and to become more thoughtful consumers of media.

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    After reading The Nielsen Norman Group's analysis of “Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing LightBoxes” highlights a critical tension in modern web design that I hadn't previously considered fully. While overlays can serve legitimate purposes, such as maintaining context or displaying urgent notifications, their widespread misuse has created significant usability problems that often outweigh their benefits. What particularly struck me was how seemingly minor design decisions, like the placement of close buttons or scroll bars, can have major implications for user accessibility and task completion.

 
                </p>
                <h2>From framework to action</h2>
                <p>
                    The article's systematic approach using the "5 W's" framework (Who, What, When, Where, and Why) provides an excellent decision-making structure for determining whether an overlay is truly necessary. This resonated strongly with me because it shifts the conversation from "How can we implement this overlay?" to "Should we implement this overlay at all?" I found myself reflecting on various websites I regularly use, noting how many of them employ overlays in ways that actively hinder rather than help the user experience - particularly those frustrating newsletter subscription popups that appear just as I'm trying to read an article.

                </p>
                <h2>Takeaway</h2>
                <p>
                    As a beginner front-end developer, this article has fundamentally changed how I'll approach overlay implementation in future projects. Rather than defaulting to overlays as a convenient solution for displaying additional content, I'll now carefully evaluate whether the same information could be better presented within the main page structure. The article's emphasis on mobile responsiveness and accessibility considerations has also heightened my awareness of how design choices that work well on desktop can create significant barriers for users on different devices or those using screen magnifiers.

                <h2>Ethics about form design</h2>
                <p>
                    Reading "Best practices for form design" gave me useful tips on making forms that put users first. The article stresses keeping things simple using clear labels, and having a logical order in form design. These methods cut down on mental effort and make it easy for people to use forms leading to happier users. One idea that stuck with me was using inline checks to give quick feedback stopping users from sending in forms with missing or wrong info. This fits with the goal of cutting down on user frustration while making forms easier to use. 
                </p>
                <h2>Duolingo's sign up flow</h2>
                <p>
                    A sign-up process that stuck with me was the one on Duolingo. It's simple, straightforward, and splits everything into bite-sized doable steps. As I went through it, the progress bars made me feel like I was getting somewhere, and the instant checks for stuff like email and password made the whole thing feel smooth and easy.
                </p>
                <h2>Why it matters for us designers</h2>
                <p>
                    The article made me realize how significant empathizing with your users is in the short and long run. Forms are ubiquitous, and when designed effectively, they can truly enhance a user's experience all throughout. This article definitely motivated me to approach my form designs with a more thoughtful perspective—focusing approach.
